# JavaScript Clock

![app-page](https://github.com/taylornoj/jsClock/blob/master/docs/clock-app.jpg?raw=true)

This project was built with starter code from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

## What I Learned About:
- second, minute and hour object methods
- dynamic values
- transform-origin css attribute (where a given 'transform' pivots from)
- transition-timing-function (adding a custom transition cubic bezier function, using Chrome Dev Tools)

App can be found here: https://taylornoj.github.io/jsClock/

In addition to completing the app as designed by the starter code, I also updated the clock face, second hand as well as hour hand to appear more readable.  I also found a different background for my app, found [here](https://www.pexels.com/search/blurred%20background/).
